Kidney Epigenome and Transcriptome-based Multi-stage Prioritization for Kidney Disease
======================================================================================

More than 800 million people suffer from kidney disease, yet the mechanism of kidney dysfunction is poorly understood, as gene-regulatory annotation of disease loci is highly incomplete. The epigenome could provide critical insight into disease understanding as it integrates genetic and environmental signals. Here we provided a comprehensive analysis of the genetic determinant of human kidney function by integrating kidney transcriptome, bulk and single cell epigenome. Our findings emphasize the key role of bulk and single-cell epigenomic information in translating genome-wide association studies into identifying causal genes, cellular origins and mechanisms of complex traits.
